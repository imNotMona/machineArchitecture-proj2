STEP 1: Read the following instructions carefully.

You will provide your solution to this part of the project by
editing the collection of functions in this source file.

INTEGER CODING RULES:

  Replace the "return" statement in each function with one
  or more lines of C code that implements the function.

  Each expression in your code can use ONLY the following:
  1. Integer constants 0 through 255 (0xFF), inclusive. You are
      not allowed to use big constants such as 0xFFFFFFFF.
  2. Function arguments and local variables (no global variables).
  3. Unary integer operations ! ~
  4. Binary integer operations & ^ | + << >>

  Some of the problems restrict the set of allowed operators even further.
  You are not restricted to one operator per line.

  You are expressly forbidden to:
  1. Use any control constructs such as if, do, while, for, switch, etc.
  2. Define or use any macros.
  3. Define any additional functions in this file.
  4. Call any functions.
  5. Use any other operators, such as &&, ||, -, or ?:
  6. Use any form of casting.
  7. Use any data type other than int. This implies that you
     cannot use arrays, structs, or unions.

  You may assume that your machine:
  1. Uses twos complement, 32-bit representations of integers.
  2. Performs right shifts arithmetically.
  3. Has unpredictable behavior when shifting if the shift amount
     is less than 0 or greater than 31.

FLOATING POINT CODING RULES

  For the problems that require you to implement floating-point operations,
  the coding rules are less strict.  You are allowed to use looping and
  conditional control.  You are allowed to use both int and unsigned variables.
  You can use arbitrary integer and unsigned constants. You can use any arithmetic,
  logical, or comparison operations on int or unsigned data.

  You are expressly forbidden to:
    1. Define or use any macros.
    2. Define any additional functions in this file.
    3. Call any functions.
    4. Use any form of casting.
    5. Use any data type other than int or unsigned.  This means that you
       cannot use arrays, structs, or unions.
    6. Use any floating point data types, operations, or constants.


NOTES:
  1. Use the ndlc program (described in the spec) to check the legality of
     your solutions.
  2. Each function has a maximum number of operations (integer, logical,
     or comparison) that you are allowed to use for your implementation
     of the function. The max operator count is checked by ndlc.
     Note that assignment ('=') is not counted; you may use as many of
     these as you want without penalty.
  3. The maximum number of ops for each function is given in the
     header comment for each function. If there are any inconsistencies
     between the maximum ops in the spec and in this file, consider
     this file the authoritative source.

STEP 2: Modify the following functions according the coding rules.

IMPORTANT. TO AVOID GRADING SURPRISES:
  1. Use the ndlc tool to check that your solutions conform to the coding rules.

YOU WILL RECEIVE NO CREDIT IF YOUR CODE DOES NOT PASS THIS CHECK.

  2. Run the provided tests to check that your solutions achieve the
     desired results.
